In this fourth installment of The Hemp Corner, we set out to better understand the amazing biochemical relationship between the human species and the cannabis plant. To get very far we have to break out some understanding of biochemical interactions in general and how they influence the human experience. 

Our guest, Dr. Jim Laurenzano, is a medical doctor who not only has a deep technical knowledge, but his 35 years of striving to engage his patient's understanding and full participation in their own treatment has given him an excellent ability to help others grasp a useful picture of what's going on, in terms they can understand. We use that skill to uncover some fascinating insights into not only cannabis, but the way life works on a biochemical level. 

Those who are into cryptographic and networking technology will find some deep, and perhaps useful, parallels.
